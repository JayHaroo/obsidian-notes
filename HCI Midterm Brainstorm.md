### **1. Homepage (Dashboard)**

- **Description:**
    - Displays an overview of the athlete’s current performance metrics, upcoming events, and recommended training plans.
    - **Contextual Adaptation:** If the weather is too harsh (e.g., extreme heat or rain), the app will recommend indoor exercises. If it detects a rest day in the athlete’s calendar, it will suggest light stretching or recovery activities. Real-time performance data is adjusted based on location, such as altitude for outdoor training.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Current fitness level (heart rate, stamina, fatigue level).
        - Weather-based recommendations.
        - Quick actions for training, recovery, or competitions.

### **2. Performance Profile Screen**

- **Description:**
    - This screen shows detailed personal stats and progress over time (speed, endurance, strength, game performance).
    - **Contextual Adaptation:** The profile adapts based on the sport the athlete is focused on. For example, a football player will see metrics like sprints, passes, and goals, while a basketball player will see metrics for jumps, points, and shooting accuracy. It also suggests drills tailored to areas where performance is lacking.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Game-specific performance breakdowns.
        - Customized progress graphs (e.g., last 30 days, current season).
        - AI-driven improvement tips.

### **3. Training Plan Screen**

- **Description:**
    - Displays a personalized training schedule based on the athlete’s current condition, goals, and upcoming games or competitions.
    - **Contextual Adaptation:** The system adjusts the intensity and type of exercises based on the athlete’s fatigue levels (measured via heart rate, sleep data, or manual input). If the app detects that the athlete is traveling or training at a different location (e.g., higher altitude), it recommends specific exercises suited to that environment.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Daily and weekly training schedules.
        - Alternative workout options based on location/weather.
        - Progress tracker for each training day.

### **4. Game Day Mode (Detail Page)**

    - **Contextual Adaptation:** Before the game, it suggests sport-specific warm-up routines based on the athlete’s condition and the environment (e.g., longer warm-ups in cold weather). Post-game, it analyzes match performance, providing immediate feedback and recovery tips (e.g., hydration, stretching). If the athlete plays at a high altitude or travels, it provides additional guidance for managing these changes.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Game day checklist (warm-ups, gear).
        - Post-game stats and recovery suggestions.
        - Match performance analysis.

If your friends or teammates are working out or have set a new personal best, the app notifies you and encourages healthy competition. It also adapts the feed to show location-specific updates (local tournaments, sport events).
    - **Key Features:**
        - Latest updates from the athlete’s network.
        - Real-time competitive challenges.
